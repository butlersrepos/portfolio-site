        description="A really wonky multiplayer rogue-like built on NodeJS
        with sockets and canvas. The only implemented features are a group-chat, 
        socket-based updates of game state, and walking into bunnies to kill them. 
        A rudimentary loot system was started but the project was side-lined as most 
        directionless projects are.">
