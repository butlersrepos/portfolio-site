    <experiment-entry title="Reduxtris" icon="gamepad" url="/reduxtris.html"
        description="An experiment in using Redux to manage the state of a game, Tetris in this case. The view layer was done in Riot first 
        with more implementations to come. All resources are automatically built through a TravisCI job and deployed to an S3 instance for
        instant 'prod deploys' to this page.">

    <experiment-entry title="Browser Demons" icon="gamepad" url="/browserdemons"
        description="A really basic multiplayer rogue-like built on NodeJS
        with sockets and canvas. The only implemented features are a group-chat, 
        socket-based updates of game state, and walking into bunnies to kill them. 
        A rudimentary loot system was started but the project was side-lined as most 
        directionless projects are.">

    <experiment-entry title="Chester Comix" icon="android" url="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chester.comix"
        description="An app I made for a friend to display his historical comics using a simple purchase model
        combined with a WordPress distribution system that he already understood well. The WordPress customizations
        allowed him to control not only adding new content/comics but also designating which comics were free at
        any given time. App subsequently released on Amazon as well.">

     <experiment-entry title="Water Jam 2015" icon="gamepad" url="/waterjam.html"
        description="Two coworkers and I made this for a very short hack-a-thon project to raise awareness about water shortage issues. 
        While NOT mobile friendly this game does showcase how crude my javascript skills were three years ago. :D Strongly based on pipe dream
        for NES and featuring free music and art assets created for this project specifically. I handled the vast majority of the javascript.">
