		I started programming back in high school but long before that I was given a Nintendo (NES) for my birthday at the age of five. 
		I consider it to be one of the most integral influences that my parents could have given me and has helped contribute
		greatly to my academic and professional success as an adult.

	<div class="sectionContent">
		Ever since that point I've held a passion for games and, more importantly, the abstract processes of problem-solving, 
		fairness, and optimization. I carry those passions into my occupations as I've carried them through my personal life. The 
		page herein is a collection or showcase of sorts for potential employers or just friends looking to see what I do with
		my spare time and my time at the office.

		I'm professionally employed as an IT Consultant and I enjoy the pace and the dynamic nature of the different clients and 
		technologies that I get to use.  I'm always on the look out for new opportunities though especially ones revolving around the 
		game industry.  If I had a dream job it would be developing games in my apartment with some friends and going out 
		for Asian food frequently.

		Most things here are either my opinion or my creation unless otherwise noted. Although I use a lot of libraries and plugins in what I do, 
		especially jQuery.  If you see anything you'd like to comment on feel free to email me <a href="mailto:eric.butler.000@gmail.com">here</a>.
