		I started programming back in high school but long before that I was given a Nintendo (NES) for my birthday at the age of five. 
		I consider it to be one of the most integral influences that my parents could have given me and has helped contribute
		greatly to my academic and professional success as an adult.
	</div>
	<div class="sectionContent">
		Ever since that point I've held a passion for games and, more importantly, the abstract processes of problem-solving, 
		fairness, and competition. I carry those passions into my occupations as I've carried them through my personal life. The
		pages here are an elaboration of me as a professional and a bit of a look into me as a person.

	<div class="sectionContent">
		I'm professionally employed as a Consultant and I enjoy the pace and the dynamic nature of the different clients and
		technologies that I get to use.  I'm always on the look out for new opportunities for growth, especially ones revolving around the 
		game industry, UI design, web technologies, and javascript.

		I'm currently located in Columbus, OH and love the city. It is by far the best place to reside in this state. However I visit California every so often and would embrace an opportunity to move out west and broaden my horizons.

            Java - The COBOL of Tomorrow!

        <div class="content">
            <div class="sectionContent">
                My first and only OOP love... for now. I started Java back in high school after having learning introductory C++ and
                found the ability to draw a smiley with only a few lines of code to be mesmerizing compared to the console applications
                we'd practiced on with C++. But my short exposure to Java would be punctuated with a six year hiatus as I went off to
                college and strayed into the qualitative world of Philosophy, then back into the quantitative world of Economics, and
                then finally (for now) into the technical world of programming again after grad school.

                I prefer Java when I'm working in OOP for it's familiarity and thus ease of syntax. I'm familiar with it's popular toolsets
                like Spring, Hibernate, Maven, JSTL. But I realize that I should be picking up languages like Groovy or Clojure to stay more
                abreast of the language. It's just hard to when there's so much more to have fun with in Javascript!

               I also program half-finished awful-looking games in Java when I have time. If you're really interested to see
               these discontinued abominations feel free to ask for my BitBucket info.

            Javascript - The Little Language that Could
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="sectionContent">
                When I first started in this field I was a "Java" guy. I had zero experience with Javascript but was informed by my then
                employer that I needed to learn it, like yesterday. So I went to work familiarizing myself with the syntax and JQuery. For
                a long time JQuery was the only way I knew Javascript.
            </div>
            <div class="sectionContent">
                In the beginning I was appalled. Var? Really? No classes? How could I extend anything?! Everything I had learned from Java
                was being eviscerated and left for dead. But my position demanded I work to write/fix/understand that language and so I did.
                Sometime later I suddenly realized that the most fun parts of my day were learning some new JQuery animation, some new CSS trick, or
                just attaching some chain of events and AJAX calls to a frontend. Before I realized what was happening I was embracing Hungarian Notation,
                Duck Typing, HashMaps as my objects. Loosely-typed just made sense in the web and I am happy to go with it.

                In my opinion these "languages" do what they're supposed to and nothing more. I respect that. Using CSS3 with pre-processors like LESS
                has allowed me to handle the majority of neat visual tricks and appearances that I have ever wanted to create. HTML5 has brought some
                nice stock tags for some features and has broken the monotony of infinite DIVs. In general I never have a bad time writing frontend code
                and enjoy CSS challenges while still trying to write maintainable selector setups. I greatly prefer in-house built CSS setups to prefab
                "frameworks" like Bootstrap.

                Node has introduced something that would be mind-blowing to me as a novice javascript coder a few years back. Seamless

                server of mine and everything from NPM to MongoDB has been intriguing and fun to work with. I have high hopes for Node.
